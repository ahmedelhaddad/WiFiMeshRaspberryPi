Hi @ahmedelhaddad, this is to get in contact with you as I am trying to use the WiFiMeshRaspberryPi repo and build a wireless access point but I am having problems with that. 
Under that repository I saw you had similar issues and you solved that, it would be great if you could help me! I know 3 years have passed but in case I would very much appreciate your insights. 

Thanks in advance!
